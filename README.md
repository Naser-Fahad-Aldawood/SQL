# SQL
To be proficient and involved in data analytics, having knowledge of SQL is essential. I recently completed a course on Coursera titled "SQL for Data Science," where I gained valuable skills and insights. Throughout the course, I learned various aspects of SQL, including:

* Selecting & retrieving data with SQL
* Filtering, sorting, and calculating data with SQL
* Subqueries and joins in SQL
* Modifying & analyzing data with SQL
